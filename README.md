This is a SwiftUI app that fetches posts from a remote API and provides functionality to view, search, and manage favorite posts. The app is built using the MVVM architecture to separate concerns and ensure maintainability. Users can browse all posts, search through them in real-time, view detailed information, and manage favorites easily.
